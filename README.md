# ATM-Project

This project aims to provide insights into various metrics related to ATM transactions and customer behavior within the banking sector.

In this project, I have meticulously curated and analyzed a dataset, implementing transformations and creating new columns to enhance data analysis capabilities. Through the utilization of measures and visualizations, I have effectively captured and presented key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to ATM utilization and customer demographics.

The project is structured into two main sections: "Demography" and "Overview." The "Overview" section provides a high-level snapshot of ATM usage trends, including total customer counts, transaction volumes, amounts, and utilization rates across different geographical and temporal dimensions. On the other hand, the "Demography" section delves deeper into customer characteristics such as age and occupation, segmenting the analysis to distinguish between new and returning customers.

I believe that this project holds significant value for stakeholders in the banking sector, offering actionable insights to inform strategic decision-making and operational optimizations.
